# Project GitGrub: A Cooking Game
Project GitGrub is a game inspired by reality shows such as Iron Chef and Hell's Kitchen, presented in a colorful illustration-driven style. The object of the game to achieve the highest possible score by completing recipes assigned by a judge.

Recipes are assigned randomly and the player is presented with a selection of ingredients. Each ingredient has a hidden point value, and some items are un-needed and therefore worth zero points! After the player selects the ingredients they believe are needed to complete the recipe - they submit their dish for judging and are assigned points!

Make it through the rounds, survive their wrath of the judge and see your name on the high-score list!

Project GitGrub was produced by Team Calendar as a week-four project for Alchemy Code Lab in May of 2018. **Team Calendar** is: Arthur Jen, Ryan Luras, Mark Myers and Zachary Tahsuda. Project GitGrub is open-source under the MIT license.
